# React Clock

This real time clock was made using React.js, as a way to practice the knowledge on React Hooks (specifically the useState function).

It is possible to view the the results on this codesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/quizzical-architecture-tc1fkt

I would like to thanks @angelabauer for all the shared knowledge.
